## Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is studied and used as a common Model Organism for genetic engineering, drug testing, and further understanding intracellular processes. There are three distinct phenotypes (shape), all of which become tedious to count manually.
## In this project, we designed a GUI interface, allowing users to simply count and distinguish between the three phases of these cells.
